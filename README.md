### Features

Wanderly has a number of features that allow users to search for hotels and flights, view search results, and access their search history and favorite destinations.

#### Hotel Search

Users can search for hotels by entering a city name, number of rooms, and date range. Once the search is performed, they can filter the results by price and rating. Users can then view the details of a hotel, including photos and location information.

#### Recent Searches

On the home page, users can view up to three of their most recent hotel searches. If they are logged in, they can view all of their recent searches. This feature helps users easily access their past searches and continue planning their travel.

#### Favorite Destinations

Users can add popular destinations to their favorite list, which will be displayed on their profile page if they are logged in. This feature allows users to save their favorite travel destinations and quickly access them for future trips.

#### Flight Search

Users can search for flights by entering the date, class, departure city, and destination city. They can also filter the results by price and the number of stops. Once they have selected a flight, they can view a mock ticket with the details of the flight.

#### Authentication

Wanderly uses Auth0 for authentication. Users can sign up and log in to access additional features such as recent search history and the ability to add destinations to their favorite list. This feature ensures that users' data is secure and only accessible by authorized individuals.
